Cross-compiling
===============

Cross-compiling a program for Redox is easy thanks to the Redox Cookbook. To get started, navigate to the cookbook folder in the Redox git repository. Build scripts in the cookbook are called recipes, so naturally they reside in the recipes folder. In this example, we'll be cross-compiling foo. Let's make a folder for our recipe.

```sh
$ cd recipes
$ mkdir foo
```

Now open your favourite text editor and create a file called recipe.sh. If you like, you can base your script off one of the other ones in the recipes folder. Here is our recipe.sh for foo:

```
```
